return the data rows as pages of 25 items at a time (25 is the default, we can give it 50, 75, 100)
this will be applied to all endpoints that return data (the GET requests)


## Error handling 
never return 500, return specified codes for all possible scenarios 


## Notification
- add a new column (notification) that will be linked to each user (many-to-one) which represents a 
notification for that user like (welcome message after signing-in, someone edited your data, ...)
- add a new field to the users entity (notifications) which will hold the notifications for that user 
- the frontend side will only need to check the notifications for that user to show them to him

- notification entity:
  - id
  - userId
  - message
  - isRead
